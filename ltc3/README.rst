PSAS Launch Tower Computer III
##############################

This subdirectory contains everything related to the third generation
launch tower computer (LTC3), with the exception of the userspace
software, which is contained in the `launch-tower-comm repo`_.

This is all very much a work in progress.  In fact, we've barely
started; there hasn't been much progress, so far.  Feel free to
contribute as you see fit.
