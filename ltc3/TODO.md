# LTC3 Master To-Do List

More or less in order of priority.  Many tasks can be completed in
parallel.


In Progress
-----------
1. Convert design files to KiCAD v5.
  * See *kicad_v5_conversion* branch.  Conversion of charge controller
    schematic is complete.

Remaining
---------
1. Assemble LTC3 board.
2. Update design files (parts subsitutions made during board assembly;
   layout errors discovered; etc.)
3. Finish the design documentation (it should at least match the
   existing design).
4. Buy a battery with a connector that gives us access between each of
   the cells.
5. Buy an enclosure,
6. Bring up Linux on the BeagleBone.
7. Create some proof-of-concept software that can at least twiddle the
   various GPIOs, relays, etc.
8. Devise a test plan for each board.
