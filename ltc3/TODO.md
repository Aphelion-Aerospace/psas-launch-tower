# LTC3 Master To-Do List

More or less in order of priority.  Many tasks can be completed in
parallel.


1. Assemble LTC3 board.
2. Convert design files to KiCAD v5.
3. Finish the design documentation (it should at least match the
   existing design).
4. Buy a battery with a connector that gives us access between each of
   the cells.
5. Buy an enclosure,
6. Bring up Linux on the BeagleBone.
7. Create some proof-of-concept software that can at least twiddle the
   various GPIOs, relays, etc.
8. Devise a test plan for each board.
