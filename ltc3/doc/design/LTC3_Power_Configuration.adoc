Does the LT8490 need to be reconfigured in order to take different
nominal input voltages?
  - pg. 14 - VINR needs to be grounded when the chip is getting direct
    DC input. (pg. 14) When panels are used, it needs to be hooked up
    to a resistor network to measure panel voltage.  This is
    implemented on pg. 35 - protection diodes are used to insulate VDC
    and VPanel, and a transistor shorts VINR when VDC is turned on.
  - We can ensure that no one uses the Lab and Panel supplies at the
    same time by just having a physical sliding cover.
	- DC current limiting for lab power

What configuration options does the LT8490 have? How should they be
configured?
  - Vmax selection - Based on the larger of panel Voc Max and DC max,
    we calculate an impedence network (pg. 14).  Minimum ckt input
    voltage is based on the selected Vmax; the lab power input and
    solar input both must exceed this level for efficient charging.
    (pg. 15).
	- Low-power mode - pg. 15
  - Simultaneous charging + discharging (in-situ; pg. 16) 
		- load connected directly across the battery terminals
    - disable charging time limits (CHARGECFG2 pin) 
    - the battery may draw below safe levels if it is charging and
      discharging simultaneously; build in protections?
  - Stage 2 charging threshold (pg. 17-18) - typically above nominal
    Vbatt; for LiPo cells this is usually 4.2V for 3.6V cell
    - Stage 3 is usually disabled for LiPo; the Stage 2 threshold is
      the most important limit for LiPo charging
	
- IMON_OUT, IMON_OUT capacitance (pg. 19, 20) - higher values reduce
  inductor current overshoot; lower values reduce ripple and give
  better ADC measurements. Need to separate pole at IMON_OUT from pole
  at Vc pin. Suggested value: 4.7 to 22nF
  - Input current limiting (pg. 19) should be panel max + 20%, but not
    dramatically higher than rated input
	- CHARGECFG1 options: (pg.20)
		- Temperature-compensated voltage limits
		- Enable/disable stage 3 (not typically used for LiPo)
    - For LiPo: Non-temperature-compensated, stage 3 disabled =
      grounded
  - CHARGECFG2 options: (pg. 22)
    - Enable/disable charge time limits: time limits not recommended
      for LiPo
    - Width of valid temp ranges (ratio > or < 0.5)
    - For LiPo: Narrow valid temp range, no time limits = grounded
  - Status/Fault LED configuration (pg. 26)
		- Use a resistor to limit STATUS current
		- FAULT self-limits on its own
		- Configure BB to interpret status/fault signals (pg. 25)
		- For our config: use resistor network as in Fig. 18
	- Switching configuration (pg. 29)
    - MODE pin above 2.3V = discontinuous conduction mode (DCM)
    - MODE below 0.4V = automatic CCM/DCM mode switching, automatic
      EXTVcc disconnect
    - For our config: tie MODE low - we typically want CCM
	- Low power mode (pg. 30)
		- Disabling: Rnlp can be connected between to FBIR.
		- For our config: no reason to disable low-power mode
	- Feedback resistor disconnect (pg. 31)
    - For our config: Feedback resistor disconnect is probably
      unnecessary for our application
    - We want voltage sensing even when batteries are not charging
    - Circuit as in fig. 26
	- EXTVcc disconnect mode (pg. 32)
    - For our config: EXTVcc disconnect is probably unnecessary
		- EXTVcc power draw is very low relative to our batteries
	- Remote batt V sensing (pg 32)
		- intended for low-voltage batteries charging at high currents
		- For our config: Not necessary.
	- Hot plugging (pg. 35)
    - We can either use the remote batt V sensing setup or use a
      staggered connector type
    - Word of god: don't worry about it for our application
