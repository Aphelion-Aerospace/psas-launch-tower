= PSAS Launch Tower Computer III Design Overview

FIXME: Feel free to make any additions or corrections.


== Abstract

The existing launch tower computer (LTC), the second major design
since the group's founding, is due for an overhaul.  It's only been
two years since LTC II was put into service, but there have been rapid
advances in available off-the-shelf technology, and our understanding
of what we need (and don't want) in an LTC has continued to evolve.


== LTC II: Pro and Con

=== The Good

* Safety interlocks!
* Solar charging.
* LIPO ignition battery.
* I/O devices are almost all USB-based.  *In situ* software
  development is not confined to the LTC's mainboard, but rather can
  take place on any Linux system equipped with USB and a comparable
  Phidgets kit.

=== The Bad

* Peripherals comprised of multiple custom PCBs, each layered with a
  variety of Phidget-based sensors.
* Phidgets.  Expensive, fiddly, and require their own interface board.
  Their software stack is thick and troublesome to install.
* Difficult to service various components without major disassembly of
  entire LTC.  Wires everywhere!


== LTC III Goals

* Simplify.
* Reduction in size: boards, batteries, enclosure.
* Field-replaceable components that can be swapped out in a reasonable
  amount of time.
* Backups for every major component.  Two is one and one is none!
* User-friendly.  Any member of PSAS should be able to achieve a
  high-level understanding of the LTC in a short amount of time.  Any
  member should be able to service the LTC given suitable
  documentation.


== Design Overview

* BeagleBone Black SBC
* Peripherals (sensors, relays, etc.) contained on a single custom
  PCB.
* BBB flipped upside down and mated to peripheral board via pin
  headers.  A kilt, rather than a cape!
* Replace lead-acid (car) batteries with high-capacity LiPo cells.
* Use a battery module in common with the rocket.
* Improved enclosure-to-tower mounting apparatus.
* Detectable rocket umbilical connection state.
* Improved external connectors (more robust).
* Improved labeling of various components, connectors, switches, etc.
* Thermal analysis!
* Smaller, metal enclosure; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_rail[DIN rail] mounting (or something
  similar).

=== External Interface

* Rocket umbilical
* Away box
* WiFi coax
* Power + Ethernet spare (future capacity)
* Debug Ethernet
* Camera triggers

=== Power Distribution Subsystem

* Solar power in
* Battery charger
* Main battery
* Ignition battery
