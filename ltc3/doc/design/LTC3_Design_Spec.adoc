= Portland State Aerospace Society Launch Tower Computer III Design Specification
PSAS Avionics Team <psas-avionics@lists.psas.pdx.edu>
v0.1, 17 March 2015: DRAFT

:imagesdir: ./images


NB: This document is most totally a work in progress.  In fact, you
shouldn't even read the following words unless you're planning on
editing them.  Move along, people...



== Summary

This document is the source of authority for all questions related to
the design and implementation of the LTC III.  If the design of the
LTC doesn't conform to this document, then either the design is
incorrect, or the document needs to be updated!



== Computer

The heart of the Launch Tower Computer III will be a BeagleBone Black
(BBB) single-board computer.

The BBB will interface with the main board via a pair of 46-pin
headers.  The main board will appear to the BBB as a standard
http://beagleboard.org/cape["cape"].  The main board will be on the
bottom, with the BBB mounted on top, upside-down.

* Cape EEPROM

== Physical

=== External Connectors

IDEA: Powerpole connectors will be mounted to the enclosure with
http://www.portableuniversalpower.com/anderson-autogrip/[Anderson
AutoGrips].  They're robust and inexpensive.
