NB: This document is most totally a work in progress.  In fact, you
shouldn't even read the following words unless you're planning on
editing them.  Move along, people...



== Summary

This document is the source of authority for all questions related to
the design and implementation of the LTC III.  If the design of the
LTC doesn't conform to this document, then either the design is
incorrect, or the document needs to be updated!



== Computer

The heart of the Launch Tower Computer III is a BeagleBone Black (BBB)
single-board computer.

The BBB interfaces with the main board via a pair of 46-pin headers.
The main board appears to the BBB as a standard
http://beagleboard.org/cape["cape"].  The main board is on the bottom,
with the BBB mounted on top, upside-down.

== Power Sources

* 12V nominal input from an external wall-mount power supply

* 17V (open circuit) PV power input

** MPPT?

* Internal LiPo power pack (10,14.4,16.8)V @ ??? AHr

** Battery charger from PV? Shore power?



== Power

=== 12-to-5 V DC-DC Converter

5 VDC power is provided by a Cincon EC4BU-12S05 DC-DC converter.
It was selected over others for its balance of voltage accuracy,
operating temperature range (full output to 85°C), and price.

=== 12-to-19 V DC-DC Converter

Finding a converter than can produce 19 VDC (or even come close) is
not easy.  Even the gold-plated Vicor is out of stock at Digi-Key.

== Ignition Subsystem
* The ignition signal is controlled by two relays in series
** One on the ignition board controlled by RocketReady (from the FC)
** One on the relay board controlled by the LTC



== Networking

* Internal Ethernet switch.


== External Device Support

LTC3 provides power and trigger support for four external devices
(e.g., cameras).

=== Power
Power is supplied through two-terminal Anderson Powerpole connectors,
each controlled independently by the computer.  Photorelays, driven
via GPIO through a MOSFET, are used to switch the 12 VDC rail to each
connector.  Current is limited by a 2 A polyfuse (PTC).

=== Triggers
Triggering is supplied through two-terminal TODO-CONNECTOR_TYPE
connectors, each controlled independently by the computer.
Photorelays, driven via GPIO through a MOSFET, are used to switch the
5 VDC rail to each connector.  Current is limited by a 500 mA polyfuse
(PTC).

An internal (on-board) selector (toggle or jumper) enables the
connector's high-side terminal to be switched to either the 5 VDC rail
or ground, whichever suits the device being triggered.  (The low side
is permanently connected to ground.)


== Physical

=== Printed Circuit Board

Trace widths must be sufficient minimize circuit impedance, and to
limit temperature rise.  Assume a maximum ambient temperature
(enclosure interior) of 60°C.  Maximum trace temperature rise should
be no more than 20°C.

=== External Connectors

IDEA: Powerpole connectors are mounted to the enclosure with
http://www.portableuniversalpower.com/anderson-autogrip/[Anderson
AutoGrips].  They're robust and inexpensive.
