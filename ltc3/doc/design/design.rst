PSAS Launch Tower Computer III Design Overview
##############################################


Abstract
========

The existing launch tower computer (LTC), the second major design
since the group's founding, is due for an overhaul.  It's only been
two years since LTC II was put into service, but we've seen rapid
advances in available off-the-shelf technology, and our understanding
of what we need (and don't want) in an LTC has evolved.


LTC II: Pro and Con
===================

FIXME: Please feel free to fill in the following pro/con lists.

The Good
--------
* I/O devices are almost all USB-based.  *In situ* software
  development is not confined to the LTC's mainboard, but rather can
  take place on any Linux system equipped with USB and a comparable
  Phidgets kit.
* LIPO launch battery.

The Bad
-------
* Difficult to service various components without major disassembly of
  entire LTC.
* Phidgets.  Expensive, fiddly, and require their own interface board.
  Their software stack is thick and troublesome to install.


LTC III Goals
=============

* Simplify.
