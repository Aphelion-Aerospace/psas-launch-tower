*.adoc files are text files encoded in AsciiDoc format.  It's a
compromise between the excessive simplicity of Markdown, and the
mind-numbing intricacies of reStructuredText.

Converting *.adoc files to "final" formats is easy.  E.g.:

	asciidoctor -b html5 happy_fun_document.adoc

	asciidoctor -b docbook happy_fun_document.adoc
	dblatex happy_fun_document.xml
