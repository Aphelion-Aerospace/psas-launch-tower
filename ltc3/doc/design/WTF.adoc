Tell me more about this _.adoc_ file, please.
---------------------------------------------

*.adoc files are text files encoded in AsciiDoc format.  It's a
compromise between the excessive simplicity of Markdown, and the
mind-numbing intricacies of reStructuredText.

Read all about it on Wikipedia:

Converting AsciiDoc files to "final" output formats is easy.  To
convert to HTML5:
----
	asciidoctor -b html5 happy_fun_document.adoc
----

To convert to PDF:
----
	asciidoctor -b docbook happy_fun_document.adoc
	dblatex happy_fun_document.xml
----
