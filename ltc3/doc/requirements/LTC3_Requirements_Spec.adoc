== Summary

The launch tower computer (LTC) is an integral component in the
Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) launch vehicle complex.  It is
responsible for providing shore power to the rocket while it remains
on the launch pad; manages the ignition safety interlock system; and
ignites the rocket motor at launch time.

The existing launch tower computer, the second major design
since the founding of the http://psas.pdx.edu/[Portland State
Aerospace Society] (PSAS), is due for an overhaul.  It's only been two
years since LTC II was put into service, but there have been rapid
advances in available off-the-shelf technology, and our understanding
of what we need (and don't want) in an LTC has continued to evolve.

This document is the source of authority for all questions related to
the requirements of the LTC III.  If the document does not conform to
the known requirements, then either the requirements are incorrect, or
the document needs to be updated!



== LTC II Review

=== The Good
* Smaller and less heavy than LTC I

* Safety interlocks!

* Solar charging.

* LiPo ignition battery.

=== The Not-So-Good

* While smaller and lighter than LTV v1, still big and bulky and a
  pain to carry around.

* Complicated, heavily mod-wired, and difficult to trace wires make it
  all hard to debug.

* The shore power DC-DC converter integrated with the power board was
  sorely inadequate.

* Lead-acid car batteries (LTC II's main power source) are bulky and
  heavy.

* http://www.phidgets.com/[Phidgets].  Expensive (relatively), fiddly,
  and require their own interface board.  Their software stack is
  thick and troublesome to install.

* The door covering the side bulkhead (power and arm switches) can't
  be closed when the shorting bar is in place.  The bar has to be
  stored elsewhere when the LTC not in use.

* The PowerPole connectors on the bottom bulkhead are too deeply
  recessed, located too close together, and poorly labeled.

== Goals

* Simplify!  LTC II has too many circuit boards, too many wires, too
  many everything.  It's difficult to service most of LTC II's
  components without major disassembly.  Peripherals (sensors, relays,
  etc.) should be contained on a single custom PCB.

* Make it smaller.  Reduce the size of the boards, batteries, and
  potentially even the enclosure.

* Use commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware whenever possible.
  COTS hardware will (ideally) have been subjected to far more
  engineering scrutiny than we'll be able to afford.

* Strive for field-replaceable units (FRU) whenever possible.  FRUs
  can be swapped out with basic tools, in a minimum amount of time.

* Make it user-friendly (i.e., fool-proof).  Any member of PSAS
  should be able to achieve a high-level understanding of the LTC in a
  short amount of time.  Any member should be able to operate, and if
  necessary service, the LTC given suitable documentation.

* Conduct a thermal analysis.  Do we need an active cooling system to
  deal with the heat of a desert launch site?

* Improve the enclosure-to-tower mounting apparatus;
  make it fast and easy to mount (and dismount) the enclosure to the
  tower (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_rail[DIN rail] mounting (or
  something similar).

* Optional: Replace LTC II's plastic enclosure with a metal enclosure, for
  durability and RFI protection, without sacrificing light weight.



== Requirements

=== Power
The LTC will receive power from the following external sources:

* Photovoltaic (PV) panels
** Provide 10.0/12.0/17.0 VDC (min., nominal, max.)

* Lab power connection
** Used when power from PV panels is not available.
** Maximum 24 VDC
** Suggested: use a ThinkPad switching "pregnant snake" power supply
   (19 VDC, several amps).

The LTC must include a bank of internal LiPo cells ("main" batteries):

* Voltage must be 10.0/14.4/16.8 VDC (min., nominal, max.).
* Capacity must be sufficient to provide power to both internal and
  external loads (approx. 4 AH).

The LTC must provide power to the following sub-systems:

* Computer
** 5 Â±0.25 VDC at 1.0 A max. (BeagleBone Black spec.)

* Rocket
** "Shore" power
** 19 VDC @ 4 A

* Ignition board
** 5 VDC.

* Ignition battery charger
** 12 VDC, direct from PV panels
** _Not_ integral to the LTC main board
** COTS hardware strongly preferred

* Several external expansion devices
** Via external connectors
** Switchable by the computer


=== Computer
* COTS single-board computer (SBC).
* Able to run a current Debian "stable" Linux system.
* Strongly prefer to keep the existing BeagleBone Black.


=== Network

* WiFi connection to Launch Control.

* Internal Ethernet switch
** Able to support the computer; rocket; several external hosts
   (debug, expansion peripherals)
** *TODO*: Switch or dumb hub? Is there any debug value to being
   able to see all traffic from one port?  Will there even be any
   traffic that does not include the computer?


=== Relays

* Internal: ignition

* External: expansion peripherals
** Power connectors
** Switch across input pair (no power)
*** Opto-isolated


=== Sensors

The LTC must provide sensors to support the following:

* Voltage on each power rail

* Current consumption
** PV panels
** Main battery
** Rocket shore power

* Temperature
** Main board
** Main battery pack
** Enclosure interior

* Rocket-ready status

* Umbilical connection state

* Ignition fuse state


=== User Interface

* Main power switch

* Ignition arming switch.

* Ignition shorting bar.

* Ignition fuse.

* Front panel display with "vital signs"
** Activated by momentary push-button.
** Suggested: a display panel driven by the computer.  Panel should be
   easily visible in broad daylight (e.g., transflective grayscale LCDs).
   Panel would need to be protected from impact damage (i.e., mounted
   behind an acrylic window).

* Front panel status LEDs
** Relays open/closed
** Rocket ready/not-ready
** External triggers activated
** Must be daylight-readable (shrouded?)

* Label all the things!  Components, connectors, switches, oh my!


=== External Connections

* Power In
** solar panels
** lab (AKA "shore shore")

* Rocket umbilical
** Ethernet, shore power, rocket-ready

* Away box

* WiFi coax to external antenna

* Expansion support
** Power connectors, connected directly to main battery rail.

** Several Ethernet connectors that provide external access to the
   LTC's internal switch, for debug and expansion purposes.

** Several expansion trigger switches, for computer control of cameras,
   etc.  Switches short two external inputs together.  Nathan proposes
   1/8" phono connectors for these.

** Expansion Ethernet and power connectors can be paired up for use
   with passive PoE injectors, providing single-cable power and network
   support for off-board devices (e.g., weather station).

* Distinct, keyed connectors for each external connection.  There
  should be no way to accidentally connect a data cable to a power
  outlet; or to reverse the polarity of a connector.


=== Enclosure

* Metal
** More robust than plastic.
** Provides greater protection from EMI than plastic.
** *TODO*: Are we concerned about a metal enclosure soaking up more
   desert heat than plastic?

* Width no greater than the tower it mounts to.

* Able to lay flat on a tabletop.

* Improved mounting apparatus
** Able to be mounted by a single individual.
** Tool-free, preferably.


=== Wish List

* Andrew strongly suggests a single-board LTC3.
** Lots of Maxim Test Points along traces between sub-systems.

* Prototyping area on main board
** 0.1" hole grid; off-board connectors

* Multiple backup LTCs.
