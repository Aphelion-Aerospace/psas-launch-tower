Can we put some regulated DC shore power into the LT8490?
Does the LT8490 need to be reconfigured in order to take different nominal input voltages?
	-pg. 14 - VINR needs to be grounded when the chip is getting direct DC input. (pg. 14)
	When panels are used, it needs to be hooked up to a resistor network to measure panel voltage.
	This is implemented on pg. 35 - protection diodes are used to insulate VDC and VPanel, and a transistor
	shorts VINR when VDC is turned on.
	-We can ensure that no one uses the Lab and Panel supplies at the same time by just having a physical sliding cover.
	-DC current limiting for lab power

What configuration options does the LT8490 have? How should they be configured?
	-Vmax selection - Based on the larger of panel Voc Max and DC max, we calculate an impedence network (pg. 14).
	Minimum ckt input voltage is based on the selected Vmax; the lab power input and solar input both must exceed this level 
	for efficient charging. (pg. 15).
	-Low-power mode - pg. 15
	-Simultaneous charging + discharging (in-situ; pg. 16) 
		+load connected directly across the battery terminals
		+disable charging time limits (CHARGECFG2 pin) 
		+the battery may draw below safe levels if it is charging and discharging simultaneously; build in protections?
	-Stage 2 charging threshold (pg. 17-18) - typically above nominal Vbatt; for LiPo cells this is usually 4.2V for 3.6V cell
	-IMON_OUT, IMON_OUT capacitance (pg. 19, 20) - higher values reduce inductor current overshoot; lower values reduce ripple 
	and give better ADC measurements. Need to separate pole at IMON_OUT from pole at Vc pin. Suggested value: 4.7 to 22nF
	-Input current limiting (pg. 19) should be panel max + 20%, but not dramatically higher than rated input
	-CHARGECFG1 options: (pg.20)
		+Temperature-compensated voltage limits
		+Enable/disable stage 3 (not typically used for LiPo)
		+For LiPo: Non-temperature-compensated, stage 3 disabled is grounded
	-CHARGECFG2 options: (page 22)
		+Enable/disable charge time limits: time limits not recommended for LiPo
		+Width of valid temp ranges (ratio > or < 0.5)

STOPPED AT PG. 22
