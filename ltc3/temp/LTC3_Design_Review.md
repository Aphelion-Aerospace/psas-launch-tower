# LTC3 Design Review


## Questions

1. The MatLab script used to calculate component values for the LT8490
   circuit is having a difficult time getting us to precisely 33.6.
   [The Internet][1] tells us that a variance of Â±50mV per cell is
   acceptable.  Presumably, it is preferable to be slightly under-
   as opposed to over-voltage.  Thoughts?
